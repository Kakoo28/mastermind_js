# Mastermind

A game of Mastermind coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

No installation is required to play the game. Simply open the index.html file
 in a web browser or [Click Here](https://kakoo28.github.io/mastermind_js/) to start playing.

## How to Play

1. The goal of the game is to guess the secret code, which consists of 4 colored pegs. Each peg can be one of six
   different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, or purple.

2. Click on the colored pegs on the right side of the screen to select the colors for your guess.

3. Once you have selected 4 colors, the game will then give you feedback on your guess by placing red and white pegs on
   the board. A black peg means that one of your colors is in the correct position, and a white peg means that one of
   your colors is in the code, but in the wrong position. It is not possible to know which color corresponds to the
   indicator.

4. Continue guessing and using the feedback until you correctly guess the code.

5. The game is over when you correctly guess the code or when you run out of turns.

## Tips

- Keep track of the pegs you've already guessed, and try to eliminate colors that can't be part of the code.

- Try to guess the code in as few turns as possible to achieve the highest score.

- The game will be reset with a random code after every win or loss, so that you can play again.

## Conclusion

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game that is fun and challenging to play. With this version, you can enjoy the
game right in your web browser, no installation required. Play it as much as you want, enjoy and have fun!
